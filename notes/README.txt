grbm, sbpl and copl:  it's obvious to see that a PL would be required at higher energy to account for the LAT emission.  Got errors for all 3.


grbm+lpow:  the lower bound on beta was not good because the model tended toward -10, which is the limit.  There was some stability near beta= -4.88 and I used that point to run errors.


sbpl+lpow:  good fit with good errors.  Because of the flexibility in the sbpl, the beta was at -3.47 which is a reasonable value.


copl+lpow:  best yet.

grbm+blackb, sbpl+blackb and copl+blackb:  okay fit and residuals, but the stats aren't great.  Needs a PL at high energies.

grbm+blackb+lpow:  beta lower limit nan.  But the fit and everything else is good.  Low BIC.

sbpl+blackb+lpow:  same as one above, but no problems with beta error.

copl+blackb+lpow:  good errors.  By far the best fit.
